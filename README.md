# QR GENERATOR - html, css, js

First time discovering, exploring and using API.
The task was to create a project that used an API fetch, free to do what we wanted beyond that.
I decided to create a QR code generator. It generates QR code based on URL.

It was a fun project and it openede my eyes to the world outside of "just" local code if that makes sense. Suddenly i could incorporate outside sources into it and it was great.

It was tough to grasp the syntax of fetching.
Also console logging to get info about the API was a challenge.
